  - heading: What is the Particle Pack?
    text: The Particle Pack is a collection of example effects that you can easily
      add to your own game or examine to learn more about Unity's Shuriken particle
      system.  Explore the example first-person scene using W,A,S, and D, and your
      mouse to look around. Stop to view a particle system and more detailed information
      on each effect will appear on-screen.

  - heading: How do I use it?
    text: To use these examples in your own projects, simply select the folder of
      effects and use the 'Export Package' command from the 'Assets' menu on the top
      bar. Depending on the effect, you may need to add the 'Shared' folder or remove
      some unnecessary scripts from the Export window. Once your effect has succesfully
      exported, import this package into your own projects using the 'Import Package'
      - 'Custom Package' option from the 'Assets' menu.
