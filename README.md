# Procedural-Animation

A small test for procedural animations. Might make a game out of it. Use the core system if you want, credits would be nice but not necessary. Thanks!

## Devlog!

Tried to fix some bugs from the chasing and shooting, as it is very unstable.
Started working on pathfinding (at the time with the NavMesh, will be later replaced with A*).
School starts tomorrow, so I wont have as much time for working on the project as I have right now,
so I'm sorry if it takes some time until the next Devlog.

Gave the two legged creature with arms a pistol and created moods (neutral, angry, dead). 
If you shoot him, he gets angry and starts chasing and shooting you. 
Shot feedback is kind of lame right now, I'm going to continue working on it before the next commit and reddit vid.
