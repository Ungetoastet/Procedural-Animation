# Procedural-Animation

A small test for procedural animations. Might make a game out of it. Use the core system if you want, credits would be nice but not necessary. Thanks!

Gave the two legged creature with arms a pistol and created moods (neutral, angry, dead). 
If you shoot him, he gets angry and starts chasing and shooting you. 
Shot feedback is kind of lame right now, I'm going to continue working on it before the next commit and reddit vid.
